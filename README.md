# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm angel, welcome to my github profile!

## What am I...

### /Learning
I'm currently partaking in the 2022 #100Devs cohort with a focus on full stack JavaScript.

### /Working on
My main project is focused on creating a fully functioning, reliable, E-commerce store to share with mom and pop shops adjusting to the pandemic and the world of online shopping. I'm also working on my portfolio to showcase my work, and a blog to start sharing my journey, thoughts, solutions, and earned knowledge of Web Development. You can also find me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kindofadev) sharpening my skills using [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/amsIII) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/amsIII).
