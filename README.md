# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm angel, welcome to my github profile!

## What am I...

### /Learning
I'm currently focusing on JavaScript and ReactJs, and some Ruby and PHP. I've recently stumbled accross GSAP and ThreeJs and will be fitting them into my schedule. 

### /Projects
My main project is focused on creating a fully functioning, reliable, E-commerce store to share with mom and pop shops adjusting to COVID and the world of online shopping. I'm also working on my portfolio to showcase my work, and a blog to start sharing my journey, thoughts, solutions, and earned knowledge of Frontend Web Development. You can also find me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1rLj8Sm3077g9Z-fpeglQ) here and there sharpening my Frontend skills using [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/amsIII).
